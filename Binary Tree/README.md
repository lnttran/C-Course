## Binary Tree
**Concept:** A binar tree is a nonlinear linked list structur i which each node may point to two other nodes, and every node but th root nodes has a single preprocessor. Binary trees expedite the proces of searching large sets of data.

**Root node:** The first node i the list. 
**Children/ child node:** the root node has pointers to two other nodes, which is called child nodes.
**Leaf node:** A nod with no children.

All pointers that do no point to node are set to nullptr.

**Subtree:** Binary tree can be divided into subtrees. A subtree is an entire branch of the tree, from one partivular node down. (EX: left subtree, right subtree)

**The height of the node** in a binary tree is the largest number of edges in a path from  target node to a leaf node.
**The depth of a node** in a binary tre is the total number of edges from the root node to the target node.
