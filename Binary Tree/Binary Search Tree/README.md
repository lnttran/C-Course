## Binary Search Tree
**Concept:** In a binary search tree, all item in each left subtree are smaller than the item in the right subtree.

**The depth of a binary search tree d** leads to O(d) operations (for all but deleting and copying the whole tree).
**The average tree depth d** is O(log N) under the assumption that al insertion sequences are equally likely. Remeber, O(log N) mean that the problem size is halved with eaxh step.
