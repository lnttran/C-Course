## 1. Friends of Classes

**Concept:** A friend is a function or class that is not a member of a class but has access to the private members of the class.

A friend function is a function that is not part of a class, that has access to the classâ€™s private members. A friend function can be a regular stand-alone function, or it can be a member of another class. ( An entire class can be declared a friend of another class.)
