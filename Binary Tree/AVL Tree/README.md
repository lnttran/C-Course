## AVL Tree
**Concept:** AVL tree is  self-balancin Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heighs of left & right subtrees cannot b mor tha one for all nodes.

### Rotation 
AVL tree cannot balance itself by default. We have to implemen re-balance funtions to balance the tree after insertion or deletion. 

To maintain the balance in AVL tree, re-balancing is done using ROTATIONS
** Left-left rotation:** 
** Right-right rotation: **
** Left-right rotatio: **
** Rightleft rotation: **
