## Introduction to the linked list ADT

**Concept:** Dynamically allocated data structures may be linked together in memory to form a chain.

A linked list is a series of connected nodes, where each node is a data structure. A linked list can grow or shrink in size as the program runs. If the new data need to be added to a linked list, the program simply allocates another node and inserts it into the series. If a particular piece of data needs to be removed from the linked list, the program deletes the node containing the data. 

- Advantages:
    - linked list can easily grow or shrink in size.
    - A node inserted into or deleted from the list is faster than vectors.
