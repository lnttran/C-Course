# Class

## 1. Introduction to classes

**Concept :** In C++, the class is the construct primarily used to create objects

- Similar to a structure
- It is data type defined by the programmer, consisting of variables and functions.
- Members of the class are private in default (cannot be accessed by programming statements outside the class).

**Access Specifier** : `private` and `public`

```cpp
double Rectangle::getArea() const 

returnType Classname::functionName(parameterList)
```

- Two colons are called *scope resolution operator.*

**Accessor :** A member function that gets a value from a classâ€™s member variable but does not change. ( EX: getWidth, getLength)

**Mutator:** A member function that assigns a value to a member variable. (EX: setWidth, setLength)
